1.06
----------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed the input bug that sneaked up in v1.05. IDirectInputDevice8::Poll() was the cause. I forgot it could return DI_NOEFFECT which is not the same as DI_OK. The bug affected devices that didn't need manual polling.

Fixed a bug that caused all soundcards without support for hardware-mixed secondary buffers to not work.

Did some small optimizations in the PPU core.

Changed so that state slots are flushed to files (if enabled) every time the user saves instead of only during load/close.

Modified the path dialog. Two check mark buttons now control the auto loading and saving of state slots.

Less sound stutter when toggling the menu in fullscreen.

Tweaked the render queue and put a limit on how many frames behind the GPU can be. This is to prevent sudden jerks and input lag.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Corrected the CRC database searcher (several games had the wrong name displayed in the title bar)

Fixed a bug that made the user defined paths not to be saved properly.

Added mapper 107 ("Magic Dragon")

Added mapper 134 ("Olympiq IQ")

Added mapper 135 ("Super Pang")

Added mapper 198 (chinese version of "Destiny of an Emperor")

Fixed a bug in the UNIF loader that caused all files having a board name beginning with NES-,UNL-,HVC-,BTL- or BMC- to be parsed wrongly.

Fixed a bug that caused the application to hang and/or crash when Alt-Tabbing.

Removed most of the sound clicks and pops heard when the audio gets disabled (menu entering, window moving etc).

Made so that all the save slots automatically gets imported/exported to/from files using <name>.ns1 through ns9 on load/close. It's ON by default.

Fixed a PPU bug that could cause the application to crash when loading up a game in the middle of an NSF tune.

Fixed the frame rate timer. In previous versions it had the potential to cause serious lagging.

Fixed the fullscreen mode cursor, sometimes it could get visible/invisible when it really shouldn't.

Changed to using C++ exceptions, way better error handling now.

In addition to the right mouse button ESCAPE now also toggles the menu in fullscreen mode.

Fixed a bug that prevented new battery-ram files from being created.

Cleaned up a few things in the DirectSound manager. Hopefully this fixes the sound problems a few people have had.

Added many new file CRC's to the internal database. Thanks to [yang] for the assembling.

Fixed so that Nestopia will recognise the Twin Famicom BIOS ROM.

Added adjustable dipswitches for "Nintendo World Championship" (mapper 105), now you can control and display the timer.

Fixed mapper 91 (IRQ counter thing), now all mapper 91 games shows the correct graphic.

Fixed a bug in the Sunsoft FME-07 sound core.

Did some cleanup in the application error handling routines - no more page-faults on known errors.

No more distortion in screen when enabling/disabling the menu in fullscreen mode (LockWindowUpdate() to the rescue).
