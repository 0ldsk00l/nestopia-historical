----------------------------------------------------------------

Given the fact that it has taken almost two years to complete this release 
I've basically lost track of the shitload of changes and fixes I've made
throughout this time, but I'll try to cover the most notable new additions.

But first, I'd like to thank all the beta testers who helped shaping up 
this release, especially Hellsbane, Michael Walsemann, Benjamin Siskoo 
and Robert Tuccitto for their dedicated time and effort in searching for
bugs.

The Windows port has been rewritten from scratch (which proved to be more
time consuming than I initially thought). The emulation core has gone 
through a complete overhaul as well.

Some of the new features:

 - DirectDraw kicked out and replaced by Direct3D (DirectX 9.0c now required)
 - More video filtering options
 - More multitasking friendly
 - Configurable menu keys
 - Less cumbersome to take screenshots and no more GDI+ requirement
 - Selectable auto-fire speed
 - Recent directories
 - Ability to lock and clear the recent files and directories lists
 - Selectable LED source for FDS disk access
 - Alternative emulation speed via assignable key/button
 - Ability to change the menu color
 - Changes to brightness/saturation/hue takes effect immediately
 - More logfile (disabled by default now) diagnostics
 - Cursor gets auto-hidden
 - Many hard-coded strings now moved into the resource section 
 - Image info for FDS and NSF files
 - Can make IPS files out of changes to FDS disk files
 - Can edit iNes file headers
 - Hq2x/Hq3x filter support
 - Additional GUI improvements

New iNes mappers:

 53, 56, 142, 158, 164, 165, 193, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208,
 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 215, 217

Fixed iNes mappers:
  
 *many*

New UNIF boards:

 Mario 1 Malee 2, Novel Diamond 9999999-in-1, Super Game 8237 
 Super 24-in-1, WS 40-in-1

New controllers:

 Oeka Kids Tablet, Hyper Shot, Crazy Climber, Mahjong, Exciting Boxing 
 Top Rider, Pokkun Moguraa

Other emu core related things:

 - More standard conformant C++ code
 - Easier to port to other platforms using a new written API
 - Many speed optimizations (but at NO cost of emulation accuracy)
 - Save state and movie file formats rewritten, old files will no longer work
 - More accurate APU and PPU emulation thanks to RE work by Blargg, Kevtris and Quietust
 - Perfectly time-aligned sound sample output by using a common clocking rate
 - Uses new updated palette by BMF
 - Better (but not perfect) NTSC color generation algorithm based on tweaks by AWJ
 - ROM database fixes and additions
 - Support for phantom stereo sound output
 - More accurate FDS emulation
 - Better sound quality with the external sound chips
 - Auto-selects between Famicom and NES 4-player adapter based on game CRC
 - More accurate emulation for several controllers
 - More accurate hard/soft reset behaviour
 
That covers most of it.	If you like this release and would like to thank me for
eating Nestopia, sleeping Nestopia and breathing Nestopia during these past two years 
consider donating a few bucks through the pay-pal link at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nestopia.
