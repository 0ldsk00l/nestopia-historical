nes_ntsc Change Log
-------------------

nes_ntsc 0.1.7
--------------
- Fixed color emphasis to affect xD colors instead of incorrectly leaving them
as always gray

- Added ability to generate a 64- or 512-color RGB palette for use when full
NTSC emulation isn't desired

- Documented more accurate burst_phase handling and included three test ROMs
for verifying proper implementation

- Moved color emphasis support to new nes_ntsc_emph_t structure, eliminating
the ugly global NES_NTSC_DISABLE_EMPHASIS configuration macro

- Extended demo to use optional Sony decoder matrix and write standard 192-byte
NES .PAL file using current settings

- Improved documentation slightly

- Lowered maximum saturation to avoid overflow of blue when blue color emphasis
is enabled


nes_ntsc 0.1.6
--------------
- Cleaned up hue, decoder matrix, and hue warping to do transformations in the
proper order and direction


nes_ntsc 0.1.5
--------------
- Added support for color emphasis/tint bits (can be turned off to reduce
memory usage)

- Added ability to specify optional decoder matrix

- Improved documentation

- Added constants for overscan borders


nes_ntsc 0.1.0
--------------
- First official version

- Completely rewrote algorithm to do all NTSC signal processing at
initialization time, putting results into a table for use during blitting. This
increased performance by over 300% and allowed many improvements in quality and
image options.

- Eliminated multiple output formats and options. Now you can define a custom
blitter for this.

- Added sharpness and "hue warping" controls

- Added option to merge even and odd artifacts to reduce flicker when host
monitor's refresh rate doesn't match emulator's frame rate.

- Added built-in horizontal rescaling. I never realized the old one was way too
wide.
