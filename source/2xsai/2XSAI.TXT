What does this program do?
==========================
This program demonstrates my 2xSaI, Super2xSaI, SuperEagle and Scale2xSaI
engines. They take PCX or BMP files as input process it using one of the
engines and output it as a PCX or BMP file.


Okay, now what do the engines do?
=================================
These engines create enhanced scaled graphics for old arcade and console
games based on the original lower resolution ones. They make it possible to
experience truly higher resolution graphics [and not the blocky 'high-res'
images we all know]. The engines created for use in emulators and are usually
usually implemented as filters for the final image rendered by the emulator,
but it should also be possible to prefilter sprites and tiles with them.


How big are the scaled images?
==============================
2xSaI, SuperEagle and Super2xSaI scale the dimensions of the image
by a factor of 2 [area is 2*2 = 4 times larger]. Scale2xSaI scales the
image to an arbitrary LARGER size. Smaller also works, but will look like
crap in most situations since it was not written for that purpose.


How do the engines work?
========================
For some general principles check out Dirk Stevens' explanation on how
his graphics enhancing Eagle engine works [http://www.retrofx.com/].
Right now there's no short answer to how my engines work, but if you're
good at analyzing source code, it's available freely available for
non-commercial use. Things to look out for in the source: bilinear filtering
and Wu lines/anti-aliasing.


What language were the engines programmed in?
=============================================
All engines are coded in C [but compiled as C++]. There are also MMX assembly
versions of the 2xSaI and SuperEagle engines. 


Some programs using one or more of the engines
==============================================
ZSNES
Snes9x (Windows and DOS versions)
SNeESE
and others.

Quick demo
==========
Execute test.bat. It will create 4 files out1.bmp through out4.bmp. Each is a
scaled image based on test.bmp. Now view the results in your favorite graphics
viewing program.


Using the utility
=================
Usage: 2xSaI <input.bmp> <output.bmp> -e <Enginenumber> -size <width> <height>
<input.bmp> and <output.bmp> must be the first two parameters!
       <input.bmp> must be an 8 or 24 bit PCX/BMP file.
       <ouput.bmp> will be a 24 bit PCX/BMP file.

Enginenumbers:
       1: 2xSaI [default]
       2: SuperEagle
       3: Super2xSaI
       4: Scale2xSaI

width and height
       Size of destination Bitmap. Used by Scale2xSaI
       Default size 640x480
